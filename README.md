# Oasis do Sul Website

Project created from scratch to introduce people to the Adventist church's Pathfinder club, of which I am a part. The project aims to showcase the club's inception as well as its activities, such as aiding those in need and scouting tasks. This was my first project using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It's worth noting that the project is not entirely completed.

## Run the project

Navigate to the project folder and double-click the "index.html" file. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can also open Visual Studio Code. If you don't have the "Live Server" extension, I recommend downloading it. After that, using Visual Studio Code, open the "index.html" file and then click on the "Go Live" button located in the bottom right corner.
